BST Tree in C
This project implements a simple Binary Search Tree (BST) in C. It reads words from a file, counts their occurrences, and records the lines they appear on. The results can be printed or saved to a file.

Features:
- Reads words from a text file and ignores numbers.
- Counts how many times each word appears.
- Records the line numbers for each word.
- Outputs the data in alphabetical order to a file or console.
