Sorting Algorithms Comparison in C

This project implements and compares various sorting algorithms. It measures the execution time for each algorithm and allows you to analyze their performance on arrays of different sizes.

Supported Sorting Algorithms:
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Selection Sort
- Mixed Sort (optimized bubble sort)
- Half Insertion Sort
- Heap Sort
- Quick Sort

Features:
- Dynamically allocates and initializes arrays with random values.
- Measures and prints the execution time for each sorting algorithm.
- Outputs the sorted array for verification (optional).
