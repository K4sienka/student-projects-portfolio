OpenGL 3D Graphics Project

This project demonstrates the use of OpenGL to create and render a 3D scene with textures, shaders, and interactive camera controls. It utilizes GLSL shaders and dynamic texture loading for visual effects.

Features:
- 3D Scene Rendering:
- Renders a textured floor, a dynamic coffee shape, and a rotating polyhedron.
- Interactive Camera:
- Mouse and keyboard control for zooming, panning, and rotating the scene.
- Shaders:
   - Vertex and fragment shaders for custom rendering effects.
- Texture Loading:
   - Supports .bmp texture files.
