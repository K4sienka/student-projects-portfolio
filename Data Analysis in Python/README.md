### **Data Analysis in Python**

This folder contains notebooks completed as part of the *Data Analysis in Python* course, including a final project that serves as a comprehensive summary of the subject. The work covers practical data analysis tasks such as data preparation, transformation, aggregation, exploratory analysis, and visualization.
The final project focuses on the analysis of macroeconomic data, including GDP and key economic indicators (e.g. unemployment), across multiple countries and time periods. The goal was to explore economic trends, compare countries over time, and derive insights from historical economic data using Python-based analysis.
