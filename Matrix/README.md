Matrix Operations in C

This project implements various matrix operations, including determinant calculation, matrix inversion, transposition, and solving systems of linear equations using the inverse matrix method.

Features:
- Create and manipulate square matrices of any size.
- Calculate the determinant of a matrix recursively.
- Transpose and invert matrices.
- Solve linear equation systems using the inverse matrix and a vector of constants.
