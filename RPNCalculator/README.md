Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) Calculator in C

This project implements an RPN calculator that evaluates mathematical expressions using two stacks: one for operators and another for operands. It supports basic arithmetic operations and handles operator precedence.

Features:
- Parses and evaluates RPN expressions entered by the user.
- Supports the operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `^` (power).
- Utilizes two stack implementations:
  - **Operator stack** for managing operations.
  - **Operand stack** for numeric values.
- Includes error handling for division by zero.
