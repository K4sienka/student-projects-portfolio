### **Computational Intelligence in Data Analysis**

This folder contains projects and exercises completed as part of the *Computational Intelligence in Data Analysis* course. The work covers key computational intelligence techniques such as neural networks, genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic systems, and Monte Carlo methods.
The notebooks focus on applying these methods to data-driven problems, experimenting with different approaches, and analyzing results in a practical, hands-on way.
